### MOTIVATION
My goal behind this project was to create a single page applications.
For a person to be able to locate shelter near them.
I know how odd of and idea it is to create a app for a homeless person.
But there are many situations that can drive a person to homelessness.
Weather it was a accident that happens to their home or a person's action leading to it.
Even a young person who's ran away from home to a person who just picked and moved to a new state.
There are a varity of uses for this app and can be used by great deal of people.

### Problem
The problem that i have ran into with creating this was first settling on a real world problem to tackle.
Another problem I still have with this app is pulling up the information from the API I found.
I know the information I want to pull and have built this app with the idea of the information in mind.

### WHAT I LEARNED
I'm not sure how to describe what I've learned through out this project.
It kind went fast with this project and didn't retain the information I had to look up while working on this.
Like for instance in bcrypt I read over saltround and understand that it controls the time needed to calculate a single hasah, but if you ask me in two weeks I might look like a deer in headlights.

### FUTURE GOALS
Well my future goals with project is to finish it completely with styling and properly getting the shelters from the API i selected.
I would also like to see if I can add hositle to this app.
In case a person doesn't want to go to a shelter at least the would have another option available to them.
I would like to add women's shelters to this app too further down the line.
I think with those additions to this app it really would stand out.
